ufloat
======

ufloat is a package that provides a fast floatingpoint extension type 
with unit support.

Requirements
============

* python 2.7 or python 3
* c build environment appropriate for your python version
* numpy
* cython (during setup)
* nose (for testing the library)

Installation
============

To build this package, setuptools, cython and numpy is required, in addition to run tests,
we require nose during setup. 

if you don't have setuptools it can be installed using the instructions given here:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#installation-instructions

The rest of the dependencies are installed if required during the setup process 
(if there is a internet connection). So it should be sufficient to do

$ python setup.py install

in the package directory (where this README is located)

To test that the package is working as intended run

$ python setup.py test

Windows
=======
 
If you are on windows and are using python(x,y), you have the mingw32 compiler
installed. Then instead of the above you should use

$ python setup.py build -cmingw32

and installation can be done using

$ python setup.py install

If you are on windows and using a 64bit build of cPython (for version 2.7 this
is usually built with the microsoft C compiler MSVC 9, which can be obtained here
