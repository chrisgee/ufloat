ufloat is a package that provides a fast floatingpoint extension type 
with unit support.

To build this package, cython is required, which can be obtained
using

$sudo easy_install cython

from here, the package can be built (provided numpy is  installed)
using

$python setup.py build

if you are on windows and are using python(x,y), you have the mingw32 compiler
installed. Then instead of the above you should use

$ python setup.py build -cmingw32

and installation can be done using

$python setup.py install
